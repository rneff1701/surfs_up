### Summary
Even though December had a lower min temperature, overall the data supports a Surf and Ice Cream shop could operate year round.  Additional weather data on sunny versus rainy days would be helpful to have to see what months are rainier than others.  Also, if there was data on the status of the ocean (temperature, wave height, etc.) that would be good to do analysis on to determine the months that have better surfing weather.
